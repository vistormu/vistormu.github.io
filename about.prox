@h1{About Me}

Hello! I am Víctor Muñoz or Vistor for short. I come from Malaga, a beautiful city in the south of Spain, known for sunshine-fried-fish combo. Growing up, my home was filled with computers, and I spent many nights watching documentaries about the universe with my dad. So I guess that's why I've always felt the need to understand things deeply, driving my mom crazy. 

I tend to intelectualize every interest I have: how does internet work? Why does music sound good? Why is there a Universe to begin with? These thoughts give me a philosophical outlook, allowing me to appreciate life more deeply, although sometimes they also lead to existential crises right before bed.

My love for understanding how things work led me to study engineering. Now, I'm working as a researcher in soft robotics, focusing mainly on software development.

@h1{Researcher}

I obtained a degree in Industrial Technology Engineering from the University of Málaga, Spain in 2021. During my academic career, I was granted two opportunities to study in South Korea, enriching my engineering education. Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Master's Degree in Robotics and Automation at the Carlos III University of Madrid, completing it in 2023.

In 2021, I worked as a researcher at the University of Málaga, focusing on the development of mechanical ventilators. I then transitioned to working at the RoboticsLab research group at the University Carlos III of Madrid in 2022, where I currently pursue the Ph.D. degree and research about applying Machine Learning methods in soft robotics.

@h1{Programmer}

I am also a passionate programmer. At my work I use Python and I have created verious libraries to boost my workflow. In my free time I like learning new languages, and Go has been my favourite one by far. This webpage is built using a custom static site generator written in Go, named @url{https://github.com/vistormu/proxima}{Proxima}. Proxima functions as a transpiler to plain HTML, and it makes building static sites very clean and simple. I am very proud of my work and I wanted to share it with you.

I do not consider myself a professional programmer, but I sure have the enthusiasm of one.

@entry{
Kimchi
}{
Kimchi is a general-purpose programming language that aims to have a simple, consistent and coherent syntax. Kimchi was part of a personal project to learn about programming language design and implementation. It is written in Go and it is based on the book <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing an Interpreter in Go</a> by Thorsten Ball.
