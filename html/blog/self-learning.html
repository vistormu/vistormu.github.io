Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend
</h2>

<p>
I started my programming journey right after finishing my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering, where I only was taught to use MATLAB. A very good friend of mine, who worked as a software engineer, was not happy with that and decided to teach me how to code like a real programmer. He told me to download Visual Studio Code and I started doing some simple things in Python. At this point, I thought there were only a handful of programming languages: a prehistoric one called C, and modern ones like C++, Python or JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
This friend of mine was always talking about something called "git", and how it could solve all of humanity's problems. I didn't understand a single word he was saying. All I could see was that he had to make the sign of the cross every time he talked about some random guy called Linus Tor-something.
</p>

<p>
One day, he grabbed a marker and started sketching on a whiteboard about the basics of git. I could understand at least why would anyone use it. I created my first repository on GitHub, and I was able to push my code to the cloud with my precious cheat sheet. However, there where some files that I didn't want to upload, like the ".vscode" folder, or the ".pyc" files. I asked my friend, and answered, "Just create a file named '.gitignore'". What? It didn't make sense to create a file with a mere extension; for example, I've never created a file named ".txt"...
</p>

<p>
With several masterclasses like this, I learned a lot from him in a very short time.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, our paths diverged.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-4 text-red font-bold" id="the-vertigo-of-ignorance">
The vertigo of ignorance
</h2>

<p>
All that time, I had been able to dodge the bullet of learning how to use the terminal. I mean, I can run my code with a beautiful green triangle, why would I need to type commands to do the same thing?
</p>

<p>
One day, my curiosity overcame my fear, and I downloaded a virtual machine to try Ubuntu. The memes were not true. I had a GUI, clickable icons, and even a file explorer. Linux was just another functional operating system?
</p>

<p>
After some time, I even dared to begin using the terminal, navigating the file system, and executing my scripts from there. I was learning a lot all by myself about the Python ecosystem, managing dependencies, and adding them to a file called "requirements.txt". Everything was going so well and I was feeling so confident...
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, I came across an installation for some package that required me to modify a hidden file called ".bashrc", and add some random line with "export" and "$PATH" in it. What was going on? From that moment on, it seemed like I was constantly running into issues that required me to copy and paste commands from Stack Overflow, without understanding what they did.
</p>

<p>
From one day to another, I went from being a confident programmer to just a simple guy who knew how ignorant he was.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-4 text-red font-bold" id="where-is-the-feedback?">
Where is the feedback?
</h2>

<p>
I started my Master's degree in Robotics, and while coursing it, I started to work in the laboratory. I was given the task to learn and apply Reinforcement Learning to control a robotic arm. However, I didn't know anything about Machine Learning, and nobody there could help me because I entered the laboratory in a peculiar moment: most of the PhD students finished their theses right before I started. Also, the supervisor, who knew that the technology could be applied, didn't have the technical knowledge. I guess that's why they hired me. 
</p>

<p>
I was already proficient in Python, so I was confident with my programming skills. However, I had to learn from scratch a whole subset of Machine Learning, with the dense mathematics, libraries, frameworks, common practices, standards, algorithms... It was overwhelming. But after some months, I was able to understand a fair amount of Reinforcement Learning, the existing algorithms, the theory behind them, and how to implement them. It wasn't easy. And I was feeling like I was behind all the time. I was the only one there who wasn't moving the robotic arm at all.
</p>

<p>
I finished my Master's thesis, and I think I did great work. I implemented an agent all by myself, and I was able to control the robotic arm with a custom and super cool Inverse Kinematics algorithm I developed. It obviously wasn't perfect or production-ready, but I was proud of my personal achievement and the novelty of my work.
</p>

<p>
However, it seemed that I solved a problem that nobody was willing to implement. I didn't receive any feedback on my work, positive or negative, and the laboratory continued with its daily routine.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-4 text-red font-bold" id="am-i-a-fraud?">
Am I a fraud?
</h2>

<p>
After my Master's degree, I started my PhD with a different group. I was assigned to model the behavior of a non-linear material using Machine Learning. Same as before, nobody there was working on that, and I had to learn everything by myself.

<p>
I noticed that, as we say in Spain, "I had started the house from the roof". I learned a lot about Reinforcement Learning, but I didn't know much about neural networks themselves. All over again I had to learn new things: PyTorch, training and validation loops, common practices... And everyone's code is different, so converging on the layout that made sense to me took a long time.
</p>

<p>
After some adjusting time, I was training a model for classification, and I was getting accuracies of 99% with low training times. I felt like all my efforts were finally paying off, so I told my colleagues and supervisors that I had finally solved the problem I was working on. I started writing a paper to go to a national conference. However, something felt wrong. I checked the code, and I noticed a bug: I miscalculated the length of my dataset, which was vital for splitting it into training and testing. The model was being trained and tested on the same data, of course, achieving high scores.
</p>

<p>
Impostor syndrome hit me hard. I was a fraud.
</p>

<p>
I had plenty of questions. Why do I have to learn this all by myself? Why isn't anyone teaching me these things?
</p>

<p>
Luckily, I was able to resolve the problem in time, I got the model to work properly, and presented the paper at the conference. No one ever knew about the bug, but my ego did.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-4 text-red font-bold" id="keep-going">
Keep going
</h2>

<p>
Despite the hardships, I have never stopped learning new things by myself. 
</p>

<p>
I discovered the existence of NeoVim, and transitioned from Visual Studio Code to it. In a matter of weeks, I was only using the terminal in my daily workflow. I was SSH-ing into my laboratory's desktop PC instead of using the GUI. I had my Tmux sessions, and I was able to disconnect from the server and reconnect later to see the progress of my training.
</p>

<p>
Then, I came across with <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing An Interpreter In Go</a> by Thorsten Ball. I learned so much from that book. I was able to understand how a programming language works, how to create a tokenizer, a parser... And I also learned Go, which is by far my favorite language right now. Go simply gets things done. Its syntax is so simple that you end up writing code that is easy to read and understand. And complexity in Go just results in more code, not more complexity.
</p>

<p>
With the power of this knowledge, I was able to create my own markup language, called <a href="https://github.com/vistormu/proxima">Proxima</a>, which transpiles to any other markup language you want. You can create Python components that can be called from your Proxima file and give logic to the documents. This webpage is written in Proxima and then transpiled to pure HTML, and I am writing my PhD thesis in Proxima too.
</p>

<p>
I have been able to find some positive feedback on these little things that make me happy.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-4 text-red font-bold" id="my-final-thoughts">
My final thoughts
</h2>

<p>
After thinking about all of this, I found out that the uncertainty is what is making self-learning hard for me. I don't know if I am learning the right way. I don't know if there is an existing solution to the problems I try to solve. I don't know if I am overcomplicating things. I don't know if I am missing something important.
</p>

<p>
I have really missed some kind of guidance in my learning process. Maybe it is unrealistic, but is my knowledge capped to a certain level because of this? And the more I advance, the more specialized the knowledge becomes, and the harder it is to find the right path.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe, I am all wrong. Maybe my curiosity is my mentor. Maybe trading suffering for knowledge is a common practice. And maybe I will become the mentor of someone else knowing how important I think it is to have one.
</p>

<p>
I don't know. I am still learning.
