<p>
	Model identification is the process of determining a mathematical representation of a system based on observed data. As its core, this method involves observing the system's input-output behaviour and then crafting a model to accurately predict or describe those behaviours.
</p>
<p>
	There are many classical approaches like least squares estimation, parametric methods... However, these methods lack the ability to make good representations of state-of-the-art complex systems. With Deep Learning, neural networks can be trained on large amounts of data to capture intricate system dynamics.
</p>
<p>
	In this blog post I will cover model identification using Machine Learning methods with the GluonTS library. I will not cover anything related to control theory, so I expect the viewer to have basic understandings of first-order systems, model identification, space state representations, and discrete control.
</p>
<p>
	I recommend reading the previous post about <a href="./gluonts.html">univariate time series forecasting with GluonTS</a> as I will not explain the use of the library with detail.

	As this blog post is focused on model identification, we will program a first-order system in python to get the data for the model.
</p>
<p>
	A model is a mathematical representation of a physical system, so it is a mere simplification of the reality. One equation that adjusts to lots of systems is the first-order differential equation:
