	What is a Final Project?
</h3>
<p>
	A final project is a project that is carried out at the end of the last year of the studies, in which the student must <span class="highlight">demonstrate the knowledge</span> acquired during its formation.
</p>
<p>
	The student will have to choose a topic, study it and develop it in a practical way. Moreover, the student will have to <span class="highlight">write a report</span> and <span class="highlight">present</span> the project to a court.
</p>
<p>
	During this project, the student will <span class="highlight">work in a laboratory</span>, where she/he will experience a professional working environment. In the laboratory there are colleagues and supervisors working as a team, and the student will have to learn how to use the tools and equipment in addition to learn how to collaborate.
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-the-student">
	What to Expect from the Student
</h3>
<p>
	The final project is carried out in a professional environment, so the student will learn how to work in it. The student must be able to work <span class="highlight">independently</span>, but also as a team. She/he must be able to solve problems and be creative. The student must be able to communicate with the supervisor, and must be able to present the project in a clear and concise way.
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="evaluation-criteria">
	Evaluation Criteria
</h3>
<p>
	The final project is evaluated by a court, which will evaluate the project and the presentation. The court will evaluate the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>
	Moreover, the supervisor will evaluate the student's work in the laboratory filling a form which will be later delivered to the court. This form contains information such as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>
	The supervisor's evaluation will have a big impact on the decision of the court.

	Communication with the Supervisor
</h3>
<p>
	The supervisor will guide you through the project and will help you to solve the problems that may arise. However, you need to have into consideration that the supervisors have heavy workload and cannot guide you into every step. So, if a problem arises, go through the following steps:
</p>
<p>
	1. Ask ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
	2. If step 1 fails, search on Google.
</p>
<p>
	3. If step 2 fails, go back to step 1 several times.
</p>
<p>
	4. If step 3 fails, now you can ask your supervisor.

	Writing the Report
</h2>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="use-of-latex">
	Use of LaTeX
</h3>
<p>
	It is highly recommended to use LaTeX to write the report. LaTeX is a typesetting system that allows the user to focus on the content of the document rather than on the format. LaTeX is widely used in the scientific community, and it is the standard for writing scientific documents.
</p>
<p>
	A good way to start using LaTeX is to use an online editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>. Overleaf is a collaborative online LaTeX editor that allows the user to write LaTeX documents without having to install any software. Overleaf also has a very good documentation, which can be found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The advantages of using LaTeX are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can focus on the content of the document rather than on the format. The PDF is automatically generated from the LaTeX source code.</li>
	<li>You can write mathematical formulas easily. Moreover, the LaTeX syntax for formulas is very standarized, being almost the only one used.</li>
	<li>The references are handled automatically and they are very easy to use.</li>
	<li>The output document looks very professional.</li>
	<li>The output document is always consistent, meaning that the same content will always generate the same output.</li>
	<li>The positioning of the images and tables are extremely easy to handle. Re-positioning an image in LaTeX will not result in weird outputs.</li>
</ul>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-report">
	Structure of the Report
</h3>
<p>
	The specific structure of the report will depend on the degree you are coursing, but I will cover the general structure and notions that are common to every scientific project.
</p>
<p>
	The report is composed of three different parts: the prebody, the body and the postbody.
</p>
<p>
	The prebody is the part of the document that is written before the actual content of the project. It should serve as guide through the document. The prebody should contain
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The cover page, with the title of the project, the author, the date, etc.</li>
	<li>The table of contents.</li>
	<li>The list of figures.</li>
	<li>The list of tables.</li>
	<li>The list of abbreviations (optional).</li>
	<li>The list of algorithms (if any).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The body should be divided into multiple chapters, ranging from 5 to even 10 chapters, depending on the multidisciplinarity of the project.
</p>
<p>
	The first chapter should always be the <span class="highlight">Introduction</span>. In this chapter the following sections must be covered:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A brief introduction to the topic of the project covering the field of research: historical importance, recent advancements...</li>
	<li>The origin of the project, covering the context in which the project was born, the relevance of your applications on that project, motivation of the deleloped work...</li>
	<li>The objectives of the project, covering the general objectives and the specific objectives.</li>
	<li>The structure of the document, covering the structure of the body and the postbody.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The last chapter should always be the <span class="highlight">Conclusions and Future Lines of Research</span>, where the two topics should be covered:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The conclusions of the project, covering the results obtained and the objectives achieved, which should be the same as in the Introduction chapter.</li>
	<li>The future lines of research, covering the possible improvements of the project and the possible applications of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The rest of the in-between chapters should depend on the project, but they should be ordered in a logical way. Usually, the rest of the chapters are ordered in the following manner:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A theoretical chapter, covering the theoretical background of the project. In this chapter the mathematical and engineering background should be covered, presenting important formulas and notation that will be useful to know for reading the project.</li>
	<li>The state-of-the-art chapter, usually named "Background" or "Related Work". In this chapter the previous work on the topic should be covered, presenting the most relevant papers and projects. This is the chapter where most of the references must be contained.</li>
	<li>The methodology chapters, covering the development and work done in the project. This is the chapter where the most technical information must be contained. Also, there should be as many chapters as considered.</li>
	<li>The experiments and results chapter, covering the results obtained in the project. This is the chapter where the most graphical information must be contained, and also the implementation details, covering repeatability...</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Every chapter should be divided into sections, being the first one an introduction to the section and the last one the conclusions of the chapter.
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="tips-and-tricks">
	Tips and Tricks
</h3>
<p>
	The Introduction and the Conclusions chapters are written at the end of the project, when the rest of the chapters are already written. This is because the Introduction and the Conclusions chapters must be consistent with the rest of the document.
</p>
<p>
	The report is not a diary, so it should not be written in chronological order, nor failed attempts. It is a report of scientific interest, so it should guide through the technological aspect only.
</p>
<p>
	The report should not include any form of first person, such as "I", "we", "our", etc. The report should be written in a impersonal form. In ENglish, the only way of doing this is using the passive form or starting every subject with a noun. In other languages such as in Spanish, the impersonal "se" is preferred.
</p>
<p>
	The implementation details are not important other than in the Experiment chapter. Do not mention any programming language, software, etc. other than in the Experiment chapter.
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="graphical-material">
	Graphical Material
</h3>
<p>
	Every figure in the document must be relevant and must be referenced in the text. The figures must be of high quality, and must be in vectorial format. The figures must be centered and must have a caption. The caption must be placed below the figure, and must be centered. The caption must be written in a way that the figure can be understood without reading the text.
</p>
<p>
	Every figure should also contain its origin. In the case of being a figure from a paper, the reference of the paper should be included. In the case of being a figure generated by the student, it should indicate it.
</p>
<p>
	I highly recommend using <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> to generate the figures. Figma is a vectorial design tool that allows the user to create high quality figures in a very easy way. Figma also has a very good documentation, which can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If you use Figma, export the figures as PDFs. LaTeX will let you include them as figures, and they will not be pixelated (infinite zoom unlocked). 
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="references">
	References
</h3>
<p>
	It is very important to cite the papers and books that have been used in the project. The references must be cited in the text, and must be included in the bibliography.
</p>
<p>
	One of the advantages of LaTeX is that the references are handled automatically. If you don't use it, be prepared for the worst.
</p>
<p>
	I wrote <a href="./bibtex.html">a tutorial</a> on how to use BibTeX, which is the standard for managing references in LaTeX. Feel free to read it.
</p>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<h3 id="supervisor's-feedback">
	Supervisor's Feedback
</h3>
<p>
	The supervisor will give you feedback on the report. The report should be delivered in PDF format and the supervisor will highlight the parts that should be changed. The drafts should be sent per chapter so that the corrections do not stack at the end.
</p>
<p>
	You should send the draft once you think it is finished, meaning that there should not be placeholders or unfinished parts. The document needs coherence to be corrected.
</p>
<p>
	You should deliver the complete draft of the report at least one month before the deadline. This will give you enough time to correct the report and to write the final version. Moreover, the deadlines are usually placed after holidays, and the supervisor would probably like to enjoy them.
