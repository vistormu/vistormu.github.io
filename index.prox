Hello! I am Vistor, a PhD Student researching in Machine Learning applications to Robotics. In this webpage you will find blog posts about various topics like tutorials, personal opinions... I hope you find it useful.

I have built this website from scratch using HTML/CSS, JavaScript and @url{https://github.com/vistormu/proxima}{Proxima}, my own wrapper of HTML to make the website code more readible and maintainable. I am just proud, okay?
